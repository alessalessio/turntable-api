# Turntable API

Turntable API is a RESTful, HATEOAS-driven API that simulates a vinyl turntable.

- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** controls power, vinyl, and playback.
- **HATEOAS** exposes valid actions via `_links`.
- **Stateless REST**: no server sessions; state is stored in the turntable resource.

Use it as a reference example for:

- Designing hypermedia APIs
- Modeling finite state machines in REST
- Teaching HATEOAS and state transitions
