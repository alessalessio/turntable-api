# Turntable API

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/banner-retro.png" width="100%" alt="Turntable API Retro Banner">
</p>

A **RESTful**, **HATEOAS-driven**, **finite-state-machine** API that simulates the behavior of a classic vinyl turntable.  
Built with **NestJS**, **TypeScript**, and a strong focus on API discoverability and correctness.

---

# Features

### Explicit FSM (Finite State Machine)
- The turntable’s power, vinyl, and playback states form a deterministic FSM.
- Every possible transition is defined and validated centrally.
- Illegal transitions return precise `409 INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION` responses.

### True HATEOAS Navigation
- Clients don’t need to hardcode workflow.
- Every response includes `_links` describing the *next allowed actions* based on the current state.

### Stateless REST API
- No server-side sessions.
- Complete state is held in the turntable resource and returned in every response.

### Built-In Vinyl Selector
- `PUT /turntable/vinyl` loads a **random** MIDI track from a curated catalog.

# State Machine Overview

The turntable’s state space is defined by:

| State Dimension | Values |
|-----------------|--------|
| `powerState` | `OFF`, `ON` |
| `vinylState` | `EMPTY`, `LOADED` |
| `playbackState` | `STOPPED`, `PLAYING` |

The FSM, HATEOAS link sets, and documentation below are **auto-generated** from `src/turntable/fsm.ts`.

To regenerate derived docs:

```bash
npm run build:fsm-docs
```

## State Machine Diagram

The turntable API implements a finite state machine with the following states and transitions:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction TB

    state "OFF / EMPTY / STOPPED" as S1
    state "OFF / LOADED / STOPPED" as S2
    state "ON / EMPTY / STOPPED" as S3
    state "ON / LOADED / STOPPED" as S4
    state "ON / LOADED / PLAYING" as S5

    [*] --> S1 : Initial State

    S1 --> S3 : power-on
    S2 --> S4 : power-on
    S3 --> S1 : power-off
    S4 --> S2 : power-off
    S3 --> S4 : put-vinyl
    S4 --> S4 : change-vinyl
    S4 --> S3 : remove-vinyl
    S4 --> S5 : play
    S5 --> S4 : stop
```

### States

| State | Power | Vinyl | Playback |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| S1 | OFF | EMPTY | STOPPED |
| S2 | OFF | LOADED | STOPPED |
| S3 | ON | EMPTY | STOPPED |
| S4 | ON | LOADED | STOPPED |
| S5 | ON | LOADED | PLAYING |


## HATEOAS Documentation

### Allowed Actions per State

Each state exposes only the actions that are valid transitions from that state.

| State | Power / Vinyl / Playback | Allowed Actions |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| S1 | OFF / EMPTY / STOPPED | `power-on` |
| S2 | OFF / LOADED / STOPPED | `power-on` |
| S3 | ON / EMPTY / STOPPED | `power-off`, `put-vinyl` |
| S4 | ON / LOADED / STOPPED | `power-off`, `change-vinyl`, `remove-vinyl`, `play` |
| S5 | ON / LOADED / PLAYING | `stop` |

### State Transitions

| Action | From | To | Method | Endpoint |
|--------|------|----|--------|----------|
| `power-on` | S1 | S3 | `POST` | `/turntable/power/on` |
| `power-on` | S2 | S4 | `POST` | `/turntable/power/on` |
| `power-off` | S3 | S1 | `POST` | `/turntable/power/off` |
| `power-off` | S4 | S2 | `POST` | `/turntable/power/off` |
| `put-vinyl` | S3 | S4 | `PUT` | `/turntable/vinyl` |
| `change-vinyl` | S4 | S4 | `PUT` | `/turntable/vinyl` |
| `remove-vinyl` | S4 | S3 | `DELETE` | `/turntable/vinyl` |
| `play` | S4 | S5 | `POST` | `/turntable/play` |
| `stop` | S5 | S4 | `POST` | `/turntable/stop` |

### Action Links Reference

| Action | Method | Endpoint |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `power-on` | `POST` | `/turntable/power/on` |
| `power-off` | `POST` | `/turntable/power/off` |
| `put-vinyl` | `PUT` | `/turntable/vinyl` |
| `change-vinyl` | `PUT` | `/turntable/vinyl` |
| `remove-vinyl` | `DELETE` | `/turntable/vinyl` |
| `play` | `POST` | `/turntable/play` |
| `stop` | `POST` | `/turntable/stop` |

### Example Response

When the turntable is in state **S4** (ON / LOADED / STOPPED), the response includes:

```json
{
  "powerState": "ON",
  "vinylState": "LOADED",
  "playbackState": "STOPPED",
  "currentVinyl": { "id": "...", "title": "...", "composer": "...", "midiUrl": "..." },
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/turntable", "method": "GET" },
    "power-off": { "href": "/turntable/power/off", "method": "POST" },
    "change-vinyl": { "href": "/turntable/vinyl", "method": "PUT" },
    "remove-vinyl": { "href": "/turntable/vinyl", "method": "DELETE" },
    "play": { "href": "/turntable/play", "method": "POST" }
  }
}
```
